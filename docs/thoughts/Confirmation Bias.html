<b><b>Confirmation Bias</b></b>
</p>

<p>
What It Is: Picture this—you've formed an opinion about something, and now you can't help but look for information that confirms it. Confirmation bias is our brain’s natural tendency to favor information that agrees with our beliefs, while ignoring anything that doesn’t fit the narrative.
</p>

<p>
Example: Imagine a marketer who's invested in a new ad campaign. They believe it’s a hit, and as they review the campaign data, they zero in on any positive feedback while skimming over the negative. Instead of making adjustments, they cling to these “wins” as proof that the campaign works. A “strong opinions, weakly held” mindset would prompt them to consider that the criticism might be just as valuable as the praise, giving them a chance to refine and improve.
