<h2 id="org2632ae4">1 Status</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2632ae4">
<p>
<b>Status</b> refers to an individual's sense of respect and importance within a group. In the workplace, a strong sense of status can
make people feel valued and engaged, driving them to contribute with confidence. When status is undermined, individuals may feel
overlooked or underappreciated, leading to disengagement and a lack of motivation. Addressing status is crucial to foster an
inclusive environment where each person feels recognized and essential to the team's success.
</p>

<p>
As the lead on a marketing team, Elena was careful to highlight her team members' unique strengths, yet she'd noticed some
individuals weren't fully engaged. One of her most capable but quiet team members, Ben, had just completed a detailed analysis of
competitors' strategies: a report that guided the whole team's next steps. Despite its significance, Ben hadn't mentioned his role in
the analysis in meetings, often deferring to others who took the spotlight.
</p>

<p>
Elena realized that if Ben's contributions went unrecognized, he might feel undervalued, eventually leading him to disengage. So,
at the next team meeting, she publicly acknowledged his hard work, explaining how his analysis had transformed their strategy. Ben
was taken aback, visibly pleased and a bit overwhelmed by the attention. As she spoke, he felt respected and noticed,
understanding that his work mattered to the team's success. Ben's confidence grew, and from that day on, he contributed more
actively, knowing that his input held weight.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Step 1:</b> Publicly acknowledge unique contributions, ensuring that individuals understand their work's value to the team.</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> Provide personalized feedback that highlights specific achievements. This helps individuals feel that their work is
meaningful and respected.</li>
<li><b>Step 3:</b> Give individuals leadership opportunities or responsibilities in their area of expertise, further reinforcing their
sense of status and role.</li>
</ul>

<p>
When Ben felt his work was acknowledged publicly, it not only validated his contribution but also made him feel like an essential
part of the team. Simple gestures like public acknowledgment can shift an individual's perception of their status, encouraging them
to bring their best.

<div id="outline-container-orgf6588e8" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf6588e8">2 Certainty</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf6588e8">
<p>
<b>Certainty</b> refers to the need for predictability and clarity in one's role and environment. When people have a clear understanding
of their tasks, goals, and future direction, they feel more grounded and secure in their work. Conversely, uncertainty can cause
stress, confusion, and disengagement. Addressing the need for certainty helps individuals feel in control, focused, and better
able to manage their responsibilities without anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Lena, a software development team lead, noticed that her team was becoming anxious as a project's launch date approached. The
project had several ambiguous elements, with details on the exact timeline and deliverables still pending. Sarah, one of the newer
developers, appeared particularly uneasy, often asking questions about expectations. Observing this, Lena decided to increase the
team's sense of Certainty by breaking down the project timeline into clear milestones, with specific goals for each.
</p>

<p>
Lena also held a brief weekly check-in meeting where she answered questions, updated the team on any changes, and reviewed their
progress. This structure provided Sarah and her colleagues with the predictability they needed to plan their work confidently.
Sarah felt much less stressed knowing exactly what was expected and by when. The clarity Lena offered helped Sarah feel more in
control, fostering a calm and focused approach to her tasks.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Step 1:</b> Break down large projects into clear milestones with specific goals, giving the team a roadmap for what lies ahead.</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> Hold regular check-ins or updates, where any changes or new information can be shared openly to reduce ambiguity.</li>
<li><b>Step 3:</b> Provide detailed expectations for individual roles, helping each team member understand their responsibilities within
the larger picture.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For Sarah, each clarified step and consistent check-in reduced her stress, helping her feel anchored in the project. Regular
communication and well-defined milestones are powerful tools for creating a sense of Certainty and focus.

<div id="outline-container-org93591dc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org93591dc">3 Autonomy</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org93591dc">
<p>
<b>Autonomy</b> is the feeling of control over one's work and choices. When individuals have the freedom to make decisions and explore
different approaches, they feel empowered and motivated. A lack of autonomy can lead to frustration and disengagement, as
individuals feel they are not trusted to make choices. Supporting autonomy allows team members to take ownership of their work,
fostering innovation and personal investment in their responsibilities.
</p>

<p>
James, the director of a creative team, noticed that his designers thrived when given room to experiment and explore. However, due
to tight project deadlines, he had recently fallen into micromanaging, often asking for frequent updates. Kelly, a talented
designer on his team, seemed particularly affected, showing signs of frustration with the lack of creative freedom.
</p>

<p>
Realizing that he was stifling his team's sense of Autonomy, James decided to shift his approach. He set clear goals for the
project and gave each team member the freedom to decide how they would meet them. James also told Kelly that she could present her
designs only once she was ready. This trust allowed Kelly to regain her creative flow, leading her to produce some of her best
work to date. She felt respected and motivated, knowing she was trusted to make choices that aligned with her creative vision.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Step 1:</b> Set clear goals and allow team members to determine the best path to reach them, giving them ownership of their
approach.</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> Avoid unnecessary check-ins, allowing individuals the space to work at their own pace and bring their ideas to
fruition independently.</li>
<li><b>Step 3:</b> Express trust by respecting team members' decisions and ideas, reinforcing their control over their work.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For Kelly, this trust in her decisions fueled her creativity, helping her produce work that exceeded expectations. Allowing team
members to exercise Autonomy can build a stronger sense of personal investment and pride in their work.

<div id="outline-container-org07fb57f" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org07fb57f">4 Relatedness</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org07fb57f">
<p>
<b>Relatedness</b> reflects our need to feel connected and secure with others. When people feel a sense of belonging and trust, they
are more likely to work effectively as part of a team. Without this sense of connection, individuals can feel isolated and
unsupported, which diminishes morale and collaboration. Cultivating relatedness ensures that people feel valued within the group,
fostering a supportive and cooperative environment.
</p>

<p>
Remote work posed a unique challenge for the team Sarah managed. Her team members had joined at different times, making it hard
for them to feel connected. She observed that some team members, like Tom, a new data analyst, seemed isolated, often only
speaking up when directly asked a question. Sarah knew that a stronger sense of Relatedness could enhance collaboration, so she
initiated informal virtual coffee breaks where team members could chat about non-work topics.
</p>

<p>
During one of these coffee breaks, Tom shared his recent hiking trip, sparking a lively conversation that helped everyone learn
more about each other's lives outside work. Gradually, Tom became more vocal in team meetings, feeling comfortable around his
colleagues and trusting them more. Sarah's efforts to foster Relatedness helped create a stronger sense of community, making each
team member feel safe and valued.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Step 1:</b> Schedule informal gatherings, like virtual coffee breaks or team lunches, where team members can connect on a personal
level.</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> Encourage team members to share personal stories or hobbies, helping them find common ground and build trust.</li>
<li><b>Step 3:</b> Facilitate team-building activities that emphasize collaboration, helping individuals feel more comfortable and
connected.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For Tom, the casual conversations and shared stories made him feel included and valued, leading to stronger trust and
collaboration. By focusing on Relatedness, leaders can create an environment where team members feel safe to share ideas and
contribute fully.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgf5b0cd0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgf5b0cd0">5 Fairness</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf5b0cd0">
<p>
<b>Fairness</b> is the perception of fair treatment and equality in decision-making. When people feel that processes are transparent
and just, they are more likely to trust leadership and remain engaged. Unfair treatment can breed resentment and a sense of
alienation, leading to low morale. Addressing fairness is essential to build a foundation of trust and cooperation within the
team.
</p>

<p>
Annie managed a sales team where a new commission structure had been introduced. However, the terms were unclear, and some team
members, like Chris, felt the structure favored certain roles over others. Frustrated, Chris began withdrawing, feeling that his
hard work wasn't rewarded fairly.
</p>

<p>
Annie noticed Chris's shift and decided to address it. She organized a team meeting to explain the commission model in detail,
offering clear, transparent data on how it was calculated. She also invited team feedback and discussed adjustments, explaining
why certain roles received different commission rates. By being open and addressing concerns, Annie restored trust in the team's
structure, allowing Chris to feel fairly treated and motivated to engage fully.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Step 1:</b> Communicate policies and decisions transparently, ensuring team members understand the reasoning behind them.</li>
<li><b>Step 2:</b> Use objective data and consistent criteria when making decisions that impact team rewards or responsibilities.</li>
<li><b>Step 3:</b> Encourage feedback and be open to addressing any perceived imbalances, building a culture of trust and transparency.</li>
</ul>

<p>
For Chris, understanding the rationale behind the commission model helped him feel valued and respected, motivating him to
continue contributing. Fairness is foundational for trust, helping team members feel secure in their roles.
