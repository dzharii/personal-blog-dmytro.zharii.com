The phrase "Strong Opinions, Weakly Held" might sound paradoxical at first, yet it's an approach that has gained traction across fields from business to tech.
Embracing this mindset can enhance decision-making and adaptability, helping you stay open to new information while still
maintaining conviction in your ideas.
This concept is especially relevant for professionals in fast-paced industries &#x2013; think tech, startups, science &#x2013; where rapid adaptation to new data or innovations can mean the difference between success and stagnation.

<p>
I have noticed this phrase first in the blog: <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/">Strong Opinions, Weakly Held</a> <code>blog.codinghorror.com</code>, that's a quote of quote:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>

</p>

<p>
A couple years ago, I was talking the Institute's <a href="http://www.iftf.org/bobjohansen/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Bob Johansen</a> about wisdom, and he explained that &#x2013; to deal with an
uncertain future and still move forward &#x2013; they advise people to have "strong opinions, which are weakly held." They've been giving this
advice for years, and I understand that it was first developed by [former] Institute Director <a href="http://www.saffo.com/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com">Paul Saffo</a>. Bob explained that weak opinions are problematic because people
aren't inspired to develop the best arguments possible for them, or to put forth the energy required to test them. Bob explained that it was
just as important, however, to not be too attached to what you believe because, otherwise, it undermines your ability to "see" and "hear"
evidence that clashes with your opinions. This is what psychologists sometimes call the problem of "confirmation bias."

And recently I have found this article, which describes the framework well:

I wonder, how this correlates with Amazon's <code>Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit</code> in <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles">Who We Are - Amazon's Leadership Principles</a> <code>www.aboutamazon.com</code>

<h2 id="org11e7cc6">What Does "Strong Opinions, Weakly Held" Mean?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org11e7cc6">
<p>
At its core, "Strong Opinions, Weakly Held" encourages people to
confidently assert their ideas or beliefs but to remain open to changing
them when new information arises. It's about:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Forming and Defending Ideas</b>: Developing opinions based on the
information available, considering them valid until better evidence or
arguments emerge.</li>
<li><b>Staying Flexible</b>: When presented with stronger evidence or logical
counterarguments, promptly reassessing or altering those opinions.</li>
<li><b>Avoiding Stagnation</b>: This mindset helps individuals and
organizations avoid getting trapped in rigid ways of thinking.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org2b88a41">Benefits of "Strong Opinions, Weakly Held"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2b88a41">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><b>Encourages Continuous Learning</b>: By remaining open to change, you're
less likely to fall into complacency and more likely to keep growing
professionally and personally.</li>
<li><b>Fosters Innovation</b>: Teams that embrace this approach tend to
innovate more freely since they're not constrained by rigid beliefs.</li>
<li><b>Improves Decision-Making</b>: This mindset can lead to better decisions,
as you're more inclined to consider diverse viewpoints and new
evidence.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="orgeab43a0">Key Biases Reduced by "Strong Opinions, Weakly Held,"</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgeab43a0">
<p>
<b><b>Confirmation Bias</b></b>
</p>

<p>
What It Is: Picture this—you've formed an opinion about something, and now you can't help but look for information that confirms it. Confirmation bias is our brain’s natural tendency to favor information that agrees with our beliefs, while ignoring anything that doesn’t fit the narrative.
</p>

<p>
Example: Imagine a marketer who's invested in a new ad campaign. They believe it’s a hit, and as they review the campaign data, they zero in on any positive feedback while skimming over the negative. Instead of making adjustments, they cling to these “wins” as proof that the campaign works. A “strong opinions, weakly held” mindset would prompt them to consider that the criticism might be just as valuable as the praise, giving them a chance to refine and improve.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Belief Perseverance</b></b>
</p>

<p>
What It Is: Once we believe something, it can be incredibly hard to let it go—even when we have new information suggesting we should. Belief perseverance is that nagging reluctance to abandon an idea, even when it’s proven wrong.
</p>

<p>
Example: Think of a scientist who’s made a name on a specific theory. Then, fresh research suggests their theory doesn’t hold up. Instead of adapting to the new evidence, they double down, perhaps discrediting the new research or finding any reason to defend their original idea. A “strong opinions, weakly held” mindset would allow them to see this new research not as a threat, but as an opportunity to expand and refine their own work.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Overconfidence Bias</b></b>
</p>

<p>
What It Is: Overconfidence bias is our tendency to believe we know more than we actually do. It makes us feel more certain about our opinions and decisions, even when we might be on shaky ground.
</p>

<p>
Example: Picture an investor who’s convinced a particular stock will soar. They’ve seen the data, they’ve done the analysis, and they’re so certain they ignore the warning signs of a shifting market. Their confidence could lead to risky decisions and potentially big losses. With a “strong opinions, weakly held” perspective, they would still feel confident but open to adjusting their plans if new market information appeared, helping them avoid costly mistakes.
</p>

<p>
<b><b>Sunk Cost Fallacy</b></b>
</p>

<p>
What It Is: Sunk cost fallacy is the “I’ve come this far, I can’t turn back now” bias. We feel compelled to stick with something we’ve invested in, even if all signs point to an undesirable outcome.
</p>

<p>
Example: Imagine a manager who has poured resources into a failing project. Despite lackluster results, they keep funneling time, money, and energy into it, thinking that abandoning it would “waste” what they’ve already spent. A “strong opinions, weakly held” mindset would help them see the sunk cost objectively, allowing them to make a rational decision to pivot or stop the project based on what’s best now, rather than on past investments.
