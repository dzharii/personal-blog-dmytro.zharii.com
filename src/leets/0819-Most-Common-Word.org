#+title: 0819. Most Common Word

* Problem

Given a paragraph and a list of banned words, your task is to find the most frequently occurring word that is not in the list of banned words. The word must be considered independently of punctuation and case.

Assume:
- The paragraph will consist of English letters, space, or punctuation marks.
- There will be no words longer than 10 characters.
- The paragraph will be non-empty.

* Solution Description

To implement this solution, we need to:

1. Normalize the input by converting all characters in the paragraph to lower case and replacing punctuation with spaces.
2. Split the normalized paragraph into individual words.
3. Use an object or Map to count occurrences of each word, ignoring any word that is in the list of banned words.
4. Determine the word with the maximum count that is not banned.

- Time Complexity: O(n + m) where n is the length of the paragraph and m is the number of words in the banned list, as parsing the paragraph and looking up the banned list is linear.
- Space Complexity: O(k) where k is the number of unique words in the paragraph minus banned words, to store the count of each word.

* Example

For a paragraph ~"Bob hit a ball, the hit BALL flew far after it was hit."~ and a banned list ~["hit"]~,
- Normalize into ~["bob", "hit", "a", "ball", "the", "hit", "ball", "flew", "far", "after", "it", "was", "hit"]~.
- Exclude ~"hit"~ from counting.
- Count the occurrences: ~{"bob": 1, "a": 1, "ball": 2, "the": 1, "flew": 1, "far": 1, "after": 1, "it": 1, "was": 1}~.
- Determine that "ball" with a count of 2 is the most frequent.

* References

For parsing and filtering words, you might look into JavaScript's ~String~ and ~RegExp~ methods for processing strings, and ~Map~ or objects for counting.
