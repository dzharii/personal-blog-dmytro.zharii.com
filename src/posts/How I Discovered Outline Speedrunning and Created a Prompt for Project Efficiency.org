The Hacker News discussion focuses on strategies for building projects quickly. Participants share insights on functional programming, rapid prototyping, and iterative development. Key points include the benefits of stateless functions, the importance of maintaining flexibility, and balancing speed with quality. The thread offers diverse perspectives and practical tips for efficient project development.

* Introduction

I've been reading the Programming Digest and found this link about speedrun outlining a few months ago. Once I started reading the article, I found that this outlining method was described in a very cool and practical manner. It essentially reiterates some good old advice on how to plan effectively by doing the outlining first.

This method reminded me of how I used to use MindMaps to outline documents, processes, and tasks in a visual and clean way. Back in 2010-2012, MindMaps were a big thing, and many people were talking about MindMapping and its benefits. The article on speedrunning outlining really brought me back to those times and I appreciated the wisdom it contained. I enjoyed reading the article because it provided a lot of valuable insights.

* Technique

The outline speedrunning technique involves a few key steps:

1. **Initial Idea and Clarification**: Start with a general idea and clarify the specific goal by asking relevant questions.
2. **Creating a High-Level Outline**: Develop a high-level outline of the project.
3. **Recursive Outlining**: Break down each item in the outline recursively until they are small and manageable.
4. **Speedrun Completion**: Quickly fill in each outline item without worrying about perfection.
5. **Perfect After Completion**: Once the entire project is outlined and filled in, go back to perfect the details.

I've been using this technique for a few months already with the help of my custom GPT, and it has proven to be incredibly effective. I was really glad to see that this article also popped up in the Hacker News feed and started an interesting discussion there.

* My Custom GPT Prompt

Based on the article and with the help of ChatGPT, I've created a custom GPT with the prompt. Here’s the prompt I created:

**Steps:**

1. **Initial Idea and Clarification:**
   - The user will share a general idea of their project.
   - Ask relevant questions to clarify the specific need and goal. Aim to ask just enough questions to gain a clear understanding without overwhelming the user.
   - Alternatively, provide several options for the outline and recursive outline to help the user visualize their project.

2. **Outline the Project:**
   - Start by making a high-level outline of the project based on the user's clarified idea.
   - For each item in the outline, create a sub-outline. Continue breaking down each item recursively until they are small and manageable.

3. **Speedrun Completion:**
   - Guide the user to fill in each outline item as quickly as possible without worrying about quality or perfection.
   - Remind the user to avoid perfecting anything during this phase.

4. **Perfect After Completion:**
   - Once the entire project is filled out, suggest going back to perfect the details.
   - Provide tips on design tweaks, aesthetic improvements, and refining the quality of the work.

5. **Critical Requirements:**
   - Outline recursively.
   - Speedrun each section without aiming for perfection.
   - Only perfect the project once it is entirely complete.

**Interactive Process:**

**First Message:**
- Remind the user of the plan for the conversation and the steps you will follow together.
