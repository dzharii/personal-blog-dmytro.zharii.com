** Introduction
I've been using Ubuntu MATE for a while now, and recently I felt the urge to tweak the appearance a bit. After exploring a few options, I decided to install the Chicago95 theme. This theme brings back the classic look of Windows 95, which I thought would be a fun and nostalgic way to customize my desktop environment.

** Installation
 I followed the auto installation instructions provided in the Chicago95 GitHub repository, and it worked really well. For detailed steps, refer to the [installation guide](https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install_auto).

As stated in the guide:

#+begin_quote
Chicago 95 comes with an automated installer. Run the ~installer.py~ python script to walk through a guided install of Chicago 95.
#+end_quote

The only issue I encountered was a missing module error for ~import gi~. To resolve this, I installed the necessary package using:

#+begin_src
   pip install PyGObject
#+end_src

I found the solution in this Stack Overflow answer: [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/71347337][Python 3: Installing gi package with pip]].

Looks awesome so far:
