* Introduction
The phrase "Strong Opinions, Weakly Held" might sound paradoxical at first, yet it's an approach that has gained traction across fields from business to tech.
Embracing this mindset can enhance decision-making and adaptability, helping you stay open to new information while still
maintaining conviction in your ideas.
This concept is especially relevant for professionals in fast-paced industries -- think tech, startups, science -- where rapid adaptation to new data or innovations can mean the difference between success and stagnation.

I have noticed this phrase first in the blog: [[https://blog.codinghorror.com/strong-opinions-weakly-held/][Strong Opinions, Weakly Held]] =blog.codinghorror.com=, that's a quote of quote:

A couple years ago, I was talking the Institute's [[http://www.iftf.org/bobjohansen/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com][Bob Johansen]] about wisdom, and he explained that -- to deal with an
uncertain future and still move forward -- they advise people to have "strong opinions, which are weakly held." They've been giving this
advice for years, and I understand that it was first developed by [former] Institute Director [[http://www.saffo.com/?ref=blog.codinghorror.com][Paul Saffo]]. Bob explained that weak opinions are problematic because people
aren't inspired to develop the best arguments possible for them, or to put forth the energy required to test them. Bob explained that it was
just as important, however, to not be too attached to what you believe because, otherwise, it undermines your ability to "see" and "hear"
evidence that clashes with your opinions. This is what psychologists sometimes call the problem of "confirmation bias."

And recently I have found this article, which describes the framework well:

I wonder, how this correlates with Amazon's ~Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit~ in [[https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles][Who We Are - Amazon's Leadership Principles]] =www.aboutamazon.com=
