**Belief Perseverance**

What It Is: Once we believe something, it can be incredibly hard to let it go—even when we have new information suggesting we should. Belief perseverance is that nagging reluctance to abandon an idea, even when it’s proven wrong.

Example: Think of a scientist who’s made a name on a specific theory. Then, fresh research suggests their theory doesn’t hold up. Instead of adapting to the new evidence, they double down, perhaps discrediting the new research or finding any reason to defend their original idea. A “strong opinions, weakly held” mindset would allow them to see this new research not as a threat, but as an opportunity to expand and refine their own work.
